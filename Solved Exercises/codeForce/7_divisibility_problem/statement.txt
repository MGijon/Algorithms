A. Divisibility Problem
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given two positive integers a and b. In one move you can increase 𝑎 by 1 (replace a with a + 1)). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b. It is possible, that you have to make 0 moves, as a is already divisible by b. You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤104
) — the number of test cases. Then 𝑡
 test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains two integers 𝑎
 and 𝑏
 (1≤𝑎,𝑏≤109
).

Output
For each test case print the answer — the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make 𝑎
 divisible by 𝑏
.
